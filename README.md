# Develhope Fullstack 17

This repository is dedicated to the live feeds of the Develhope Fullstack 17 course 



## What you will find

 - the folders are divided like the chapters of the course
 - in each folder you will find another folder with the name **live** with all the work done during the live session related to the chapter
 - finally another folder with the name **exercises** where you can find extra exercises to do at home 
**IMPORTANT**: do not push into the exercises folder, it is only used to get the exercises to do on your local PC.
